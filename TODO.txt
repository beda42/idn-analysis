- use both "o" and "oe" transliterations simultaneously for German
  - we should have 3 results - transliterations to "o", "oe" and "both"
- split off words that occur only in form without diacritics from the total tally
- split counts into the cases where the base form is included in the variants and where it is not
- provide examples of the more frequent collisions
